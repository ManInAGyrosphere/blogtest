    <h1>My Skills as an Editor</h1>
    <p>My skills as a video editor and potential animator.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<h2>What I know</h2>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am capable of adding and editing sound effects and videos.</li>
        <li>Using the motion tracker to track faces when ever something needs to be censored.</li>
        <li>Zooming in and out of videos.</li>
        <li>My way of animating is to draw characters doing action for each frame on a drawing software
            and export the images to the software.
        </li>
        <li> My favorite animation method is the Walt Disney method.
            Drawing the primary poses for the character and draw more poses between to make the character look like theyre moving.</li>
    </ul>
